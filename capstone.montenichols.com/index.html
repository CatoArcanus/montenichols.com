    <h2> Game Programmers: </h2>

    <p>This is the contact page for Monte Nichols and Tyler Reed. We are gathering a team of talented 

	programmers and game developers to create a project pitch for the Fall Computer Science 

	Capstone project at University of Texas at Dallas. We will be working over the summer to create 

	the project pitch and preliminary design specs. Once the semester starts we will move into a full 

	software development process to create the game.</p>

	<p>The game itself will be made using the Game Maker IDE. It uses an OOP proprietary language 

	similar to C++. Learning the interface should be quick and easy. The IDE itself will simplify 

	our development process. We will use its PHP hook to a Domain to reach other languages 

	such as PHP, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, SQL, and more. If you want to use a language that can 

	communicate with one or more of these languages, or read/write JSON files/objects, it may be 

	used in this project.</p>

	<p>The game’s features will depend upon who is on the team. The project of the game is to 

	demonstrate the abilities of our team, and not necessarily make the next-best game. While 

	artwork, narrative, and other non-technical assets will be required, they are not going to be our 

	primary focus unless a team member wishes to put forth the effort to do so.</p>
	
	<br />
	<p>As far as technical features go, the game is currently planned to demonstrate the following:</p>

    <ul>
		<li>Top-Down View Point (<i>For simplicity</i>)</li>

		<li>Browser-Target (<i>To allow interfacing with PHP, SQL, etc</i>)</li>

		<li>Artificial Intelligence (<i>Motion-Planning, Path-Finding, etc</i>)</li>
		
		<li>Basic Databasing (<i>Using MySQL and PHPMyAdmin</i>)</li>

		<li>Single Player Focus (<i>Multiplayer Design, should this feature change</i>)</li>

		<li>Unique Mechanic and/or Dynamic</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are some other features that we want to avoid. These decisions were made to avoid an 

		over-complex project or was perceived as poor game design: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Extensive Narrative (<i>Not our Focus. Keep it short and simple</i>)</li>

		<li>Extensive Artwork (<i>Not our Focus. However, Shaders and Graphical Manipulation are 
		acceptable</i>)</li>
		
		<li>Extensive Sound and Music (<i>Not our Focus. Free Libraries will likely be used</i>)</li>

		<li>Clones (<i>Let’s be innovative. Spin-Offs are acceptable</i>)</li>

		<li>Single Strategy (<i>The features should be dynamic enough to require the Player(s) to 

			approach problems from multiple perspectives</i>)</li>

		<li>Obvious Transitivity (<i>Strategy is too simple</i>)</li>

		<li>Huge Randomness (<i>The Player(s) should get roughly the same result each time</i>)</li>

		<li>Terrain Generation (<i>This is very complicated. Unless a member wishes to implement this, 

			we will try to avoid it</i>)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br />
	
	<p> All features that we want and those that we are avoiding are subject to change, and may be

		negotiated by new members. Our current design is general enough to accept new members, and 

		by adding in their requests, our game will reach a narrower focus.</p>
		
    <p> Right now these are the only specifications. We are looking for talented programmers with 

		experience in game programming and game modification. This will be your project and we want 

		you to be passionate about what you create. We want this project to be the perfect piece for your 

		portfolio: tell us what skills you want to show off.</p>
